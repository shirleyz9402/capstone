# Biblio (capstone)

Biblio uses a Rails backend and a React frontend. It also implements Epub.js which is a JavaScript library for rendering eBooks in the browser. Filestack, a third party file host website, is used to store uploaded eBooks.

Biblio is a book sharing app that allows users to upload, browse, and read books in the browser. Users can also create libraries and save books to it. Upon registering, every user has a "Your Uploads" library which keeps track of the books the user has uploaded and allows them to delete them if they wish. When a book is uploaded by any user, all other users have access to it. Besides browsing through books, users can also browse through other libraries that have been created. Users can also search through uploaded books by author or title and they can search through libraries by name.
